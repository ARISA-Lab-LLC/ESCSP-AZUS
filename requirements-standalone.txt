# Minimal dependencies for uploads without Prefect

# Core dependencies
pydantic>=2.0.0
requests>=2.28.0

# For Zenodo metadata models

# Note: prefect-invenio-rdm is still needed for the models
# (DraftConfig, Access, etc.) but the Prefect server is not required
# to run the standalone upload script
